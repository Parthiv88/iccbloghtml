    The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the global governing body of cricket.
    It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from Australia, England, and South
    Africa.
    It was renamed as the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and adopted its current name in 1987.
    The ICC has its headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ICC currently has 108 member nations: 12 Full Members that play Test matches, and 96 Associate Members.
    The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most
    notably the Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup, and ICC World Test Championship.
    It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day Internationals and
    Twenty20 Internationals.
    It promulgates the ICC Code of Conduct, which sets professional standards of discipline for international cricket,
    and also co-ordinates action against corruption and match-fixing through its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit
    (ACSU)
  </p>

  <p>
    The ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries (which include all Test matches outside of the
    World Test Championship Final), and neither does it govern domestic cricket within member countries.
    It does not make or alter the laws of the game, which have remained under the governance of the Marylebone Cricket
    Club since 1788.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Chairman heads the board of directors and on June 26, 2014, Narayanaswami Srinivasan, the former president of
    BCCI, was announced as the first chairman of the council.
    The role of ICC president became a largely honorary position after the establishment of the chairman role and other
    changes made to the ICC constitution in 2014.
    It has been claimed that the 2014 changes have handed control to the 'Big Three' nations of England, India and
    Australia.The last ICC president was Zaheer Abbas, who was appointed in June 2015 following the resignation of
    Mustafa Kamal in April 2015.
    When the post of ICC president was abolished in April 2016, Shashank Manohar, who replaced Srinivasan in October
    2015, became the first independent elected chairman of the ICC.[
